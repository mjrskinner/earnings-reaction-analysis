# Earnings-Reaction-Analysis

This project aims to analyze reactions to earnings calls by measuring the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) for stocks in the S&P 500. The key periods for measurement are from the time of the earnings announcement to the next market close, the end of the following week (5 business days), approximately one month later (21 business days), and up to the subsequent quarterly earnings date. 

Currently, the existing code successfully collects data on earnings dates, earnings surprises, analyst estimates, actual earnings figures, and the time until the market opens. However, there are challenges in accurately calculating the PEAD, primarily due to issues related to data collection.
