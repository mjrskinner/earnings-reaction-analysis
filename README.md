# earnings-reaction-analysis
Measurements of the reactions to earnings calls.  I'm hoping to measure post-earnings announcement drift for stocks in the S&P 500, from the time of the announcement to the next market close, the end of the next week (5 business days), 21 business days (roughly a month), and to the next earnings date (quarter).  Currently, I have code that successfully collects the earnings dates, surprises, analyst estimates, and real value, as well as the time until the market opens.  However, there are issues in calculating the PEAD which are mainly to do with data collection.
